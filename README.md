SavageCore
==========

A core mod for some of my Minecraft mods.  

MOD INFO
========
Minecraft Version: 1.17.1  
Forge Version: 37.1.1+  

Known Errors
============
Regarding Forge Version Checks: You may see errors when Forge runs its version check against my mods. This is due to the setup of my website and the secure connections between it. This will not change unless the version check system gets updated to support secure connections. SavageCore has a built in version checker for all the mods that require it, if you leave this setting enabled, you will know when mods are outdated via an in-game message.
